Task 3: Product Catalog Management System (Using XML)

Background:
An e-commerce company wants to develop a product catalog management system to organize and manage its product inventory. The system should allow administrators to add new products, update product information, delete products, and export the product catalog in XML format.

Questions:

Product Data Management:
Develop a Python program that interacts with an XML file to handle product data management operations.
Implement functions to add new products to the catalog, update existing product information, delete products by their ID, and retrieve product details.
Use XML format to represent product data in a structured format, with each product represented as an XML element.
Enhance the Python program to include functionality for exporting the product catalog as an XML file.

Database Connectivity
Task 1: Write a Python script that connects to an SQLite3 database file, creates a table books with columns title, author, and year, and inserts multiple rows of data into the table.
Task 2: Extend the previous SQLite3 task by adding functionality to select a book by title, update the author of a book, and delete a book from the books table.

Comprehension, Iterators, Generator, Decorators , Lambda function
Task 1: Write a list comprehension that creates a list of squares for all even numbers between 0 and 20.
Task 2: Create a custom iterator class ReverseIter, which takes a list and iterates it from the reverse direction.
Task 3: Write a generator function fib_gen that yields the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number n.
Task 4: Create a filter using a lambda function that extracts all words from a list that have more than 4 characters.


Pytest
Task 1: Write a program with setup_method and teardown_method to prepare a temporary directory before each test method and delete it after.
Task 2: Write a test that validates an exception is raised when invalid input is provided to a function. Use a condition of voting age as a parameter.
